## ShareTube — Development Rules of Engagement

### Status
- **Active development**: Breaking changes are acceptable. Favor velocity over stability in dev.
- **Scope**: Backend `v1-01` and the browser extension evolve together.

### Sources of Truth
- **GAMEPLAN.md is a living document**: Keep it aligned with implemented code. If a request contradicts it, follow the request, then reconcile docs.
- **Models and contracts must reflect intent**: When changing schemas or events, update `models.py`, realtime contracts, and `GAMEPLAN.md` in the same change when possible.

### Data Model Principles
- Virtual clock is **per queue entry** (on `QueueEntry`), not on `Room`.
- `Room` holds control/permissions and the `current_entry_id`.
- Queue policy and rotation are as described in `GAMEPLAN.md`; adjust pragmatically when needed.

### Workflow for Changes
- Backward-incompatible changes are fine.
- Prefer small, atomic edits with clear intent.
- When a change touches schema + docs + client logic, update all affected areas together.
- Add a short Decision Record to `GAMEPLAN.md` when making notable choices.
- Default to implementing without asking for approval unless blocked or ambiguous.

### Quality Bars (Dev)
- Keep code lint-clean; add types where helpful; avoid dead code.
- Comments only for non-obvious rationale, invariants, or caveats.
- Tests are incremental; prioritize state-machine and contract-critical paths first.

### Migrations and DB
- SQLite in dev is disposable. You may drop and recreate the DB when convenient.
- Alembic migrations are recommended but optional during rapid iteration.

### Security and Auth
- Google OAuth + backend-issued JWT are required; keep tokens short-lived.
- Validation/rate-limits can be stubbed in early phases but should be respected in public deploys.
