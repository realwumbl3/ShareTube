Root directory (project root): /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/

Any imports needed from the main app should be imported in the shared_imports.py file and imported from there.

You may inspect other subdirectories under /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/, but do not modify them.

When opening any file, always open it from the working directory and not from the root directory.

Do not attempt to run Python directly (e.g., do not run `python app.py`). Instruct the user to use the restart.sh script instead.
