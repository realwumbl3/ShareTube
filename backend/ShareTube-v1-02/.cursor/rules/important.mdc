ROOT = PROJECTS REAL ROOT DIRECTORY: /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/

WORKING = WHERE WE CURRENTLY ARE: /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/ShareTube-v1-02/

VERSION = ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT VERSION: ShareTube-v1-02

ignore contents of other /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/ sub-directories.

ONLY WORK WITHIN THIS(WORKING) DIRECTORY

STAY OUT OF .root (it's a symbolic link to the ROOT directory)

.instance takes you to /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/instance/ShareTube-v1-02/ where the database/logs/runtime files are stored

when opening a file, always open it from the WORKING directory and not from the ROOT directory
