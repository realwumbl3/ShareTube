Root directory (project root): /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/
Working directory (this workspace): /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/ShareTube-v1-02/
Active development version: ShareTube-v1-02

You may inspect other subdirectories under /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/, but do not modify them.

Work exclusively inside the working directory. You may view .root, but do not modify within it (it is a symbolic link to the project root).

The .instance path refers to: /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/instance/ShareTube-v1-02/, where databases, logs, and runtime files are stored.

When opening any file, always open it from the working directory and not from the root directory.

Do not attempt to run Python directly (e.g., do not run `python app.py`). Instruct the user to use the restart.sh script instead.
