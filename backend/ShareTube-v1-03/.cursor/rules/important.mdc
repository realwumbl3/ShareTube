Root directory (project root): /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/
Working directory (this workspace): /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/ShareTube-v1-03/
Active development version: ShareTube-v1-03

You may inspect other subdirectories under /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/backend/, but do not modify them.

Work exclusively inside the working directory. You may view .root, but do not modify within it (it is a symbolic link to the project root).

The .instance path refers to: /home/wumbl3wsl/ShareTube/instance/ShareTube-v1-03/, where databases, logs, and runtime files are stored.

When opening any file, always open it from the working directory and not from the root directory.

This is a MV3 (Manifest V3) Chrome extension. Pollyfilling is not allowed. Use the latest features and APIs available in the Chrome extension API.

The extension is loaded in chrome://extensions/ and I inspect it using developer tools including sockets messages and the console.
