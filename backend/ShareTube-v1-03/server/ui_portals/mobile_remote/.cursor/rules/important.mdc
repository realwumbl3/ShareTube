DO NOT MAKE CHANGES THAT MIGHT BREAK THE MAIN EXTENSION APP.

Any imports needed from the main app should be imported in /pages/{page_name}/shared_imports.py file found in the root directory of this sub-application.

When opening any file, always try to open it from the working directory and not from "full path" directory.

Do not attempt to run Python directly (e.g., do not run `python app.py`). The server is hot-reloaded automatically.

It is possible to import code from the browser extension in this sub-application. Use the @extension/app/ prefix to import code from the browser extension.

Example:

```javascript
import { io } from "/extension/app/@dep/socket.io.min.esm.js";
import VirtualPlayer from "/extension/app/virtualPlayer.js";
```
