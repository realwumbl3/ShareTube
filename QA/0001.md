# SHOULDN'T BUT DOES.

- Player shouldn't send player_status all the time, it's spammy and not optimized, only send player status updates when needed.

- When a user seeks using the youtube player, the currenttime is synced only on the second click for some reason, it should happen on the first click.


# SHOULD BUT DOESN'T.

- Player Control Button - 
    - Durring ADs the button should show "Playing AD" on hover it should turn into a pause button that pauses the room state, but not the ADs. at the end of the ads the video shouldn't resume for the users.

- Youtube player should be able to be used to control the room play/pause state

- If a user was already in the middle of a video and youtube tries to resume it at the time they left off but a video is set to start, make sure the timestamp is at 0:00


# DOES, BUT SHOULDN'T.


- Users sometime report they're watching an ad when the video has finished playing.

- When pausing the video is set back to the start when it should store progress for next time it's resumed.

- AD detection durring video page load can fail and users aren't paused or aware of other users are watching an AD. dashboard reports proper player AD status, problem is elsewhere.


# SOMETIMES DOES WHEN IT SHOULDN'T?
